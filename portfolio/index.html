					<h2>Latin Resources</h2>
					<p>The Latin Resources App was developed in the summer of 2016 by me and Akhil Mandalapu. I primarily focused on the Android version of the app ("The JCL App" on Play Store) as well as the backend while Akhil worked on the iOS version of the app and the frontend. This was my first larger scale project, and gained a lot of insight into the development process from working on this, especially the importance of version control, organization, and dealing with frustration constructively.</p>

					<h2>Houston Helps</h2>
					<p>HoustonHelps is a web application developed for the 2017 Houston Hackathon. The main premise of HoustonHelps is to link members of the Houston community who unfortunately are not able to afford basic necesseties with CraigsList donors who are ready to help. Using a custom built API, HH scrapes all items within a close proximity of the user that are free. Additionally, HH provides a hard-lined screening process which verifies all donors to ensure safety in all transactions.</p>

					<h2>Inquis</h2>
					<p>Inquis is a mobile application developed to improve communication between patients with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and researchers. The main goals of the product are to provide patients with a place to log their day to day experiences as well as to provide ASD researchers with an anonymous database to enable further research about ASD. Inquis was entered into the 2018 SPARK for Autism Mobile Application Contest where it won first place in the prototype division. Furthermore, in 2019, Inquis made it to the regional judging round of the Diamond Challenge. Inquis is now available both on the iOS App Store as well as on the Google Play Store.</p>
