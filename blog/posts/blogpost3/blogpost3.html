			<h1 style="font-style: bold">Growing Technological Influence in Bosnia</h1>
			<h6 class="date">January 21, 2020</h6>

			<p>One morning, as I woozily began my long trek to school, I crossed a set of young children playing some form of tag while shouting in rapid Bosnian. When they caught site of me, who they were easily able to identify as a foreigner, they all rummaged through their backpacks. Confused, I stopped to see what they were searching for. One by one, each of them raised their heads with a pencil and slip of paper in their hands. As they turned to face me, they cautiously whispered the phrase, "Like and subscribe to my YouTube channel!" This caught me completely off guard, but as I continued to think about that for the next hour during the rest of my walk (or sprint, due to the delay!), I realized that as one of the many signs of technology and social media inserting itself into the daily life of many people.</p>

			<p>As soon as you step foot into Sarajevo, the ubiquity of technology isn't readily apparent. Most of its streets stray far from the flashy displays of those in cities such as New York or Tokyo, and unlike in many places in the US, a quick glance in highly concentrated public areas reveals an unusual absence of phones and technology in the hands of pedestrians. However, this image doesn't truly reflect the presence of technology within this community.</p>

			<p>When I first came to school, I was both anxious and excited to interact with Bosnian kids within a similar age range as me. Specifically, I was looking forward to learning about Bosnian youth culture while also being able to show others my cultural background as well as general aspects of American culture. However, although I do attend an international school, I certainly did not expect most of the students to be as aware of American culture or fluent in English as they are. As I got to know them throughout the first few months of my exchange, I learned that they engaged in and learned from similar forms of media as me, including YouTube and Reddit, and as a result, they shared certain pieces of knowledge and opinions with me. However, I feel that the international education background of these students provided vital context to these kids, which in turn allowed them to filter between more reputable forms of content in contrast to more misleading things found online.</p>

			<p>However, I have also seen certain aspects of this latter form of content throughout my interactions with people. One specific case of this is the general perception of Americans. As I met more people who hadn't interacted with Americans before, I encountered several interesting stereotypes about us. The most poignant one of these was brought up during an exchange with another teenager who I met at a local cafe. When he found out that I was American, he immediately questioned my intentions in Bosnia, remarking, "Why are you here? I thought Americans hate Muslims!" Although I was aware that such a mindset would be present here, I was shocked and saddened to hear it first hand. Additionally, I was quite curious to see what he based that viewpoint off of. After assuring him that a majority of America was constitued by very open-minded and accepting people, I asked him what had led him to that conclusion. He pulled out his phone and showed me some videos he had saved from Alex Jones. Here, I realized the importance of my presence here, as being an actual person as opposed to a talking head, I had the ability to demonstrate the real ideals and situation of normal Americans.</p>

			<p>Overall, the idea of the reliance on technology is an oft-discussed topic within nations itself, but I believe that it is much more important to consider when thinking about a global setting. Technology has the amazing power to unite people from all ends of the globe together under similar cultures. However, it remains our job to ensure that we communicate who we really are as a people, a nation, a culture, when we express ourselves on these platforms.</p>
