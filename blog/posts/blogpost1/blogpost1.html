			<h1 style="font-style: bold">The Beauty and Applicability of Languages</h1>
			<h6 class="date">September 1, 2019</h6>
			<p>As a Latin student for the past five (going on six) years, I have long grappled with the question of the applicability of my Latin knowledge. I often faced questions about the "point of investing time into learning a dead language", and honestly, although I always responded that learning the language would help me with my English vocabulary and grammar, I myself doubted its use. To be specific, I felt that the vocabulary obtained from Latin by English was sparse and self-explanaotry, and that many of the complex grammatical structures of Latin were merely formalities in English. However, I feel that the first 5 days of BCS classes here in Sarajevo have made me much more confident about my love of Latin, and languages in general, for these many years.</p>

			<p>I've been in Latin classes with five different teachers throughout middle and high schools, and there are a few patterns I've observed in them. For one thing, unlike many other languages, with regards to the oral aspects of the language, learning Latin is purely focused on the pronounciation and enunciation of prewritten documents. In other words, when you learn Latin in school, you don't learn how to enter into free conversation with others. Additionally, the passages that Latin classes are based on typically employ Classical era terminologies, which in turn do not bode so well for conversation (When discussing this topic with others, I like to bring up a scene in <div class="italics">The Office</div> where Dwight reads the German section of a setup manual for a copier, remarking that it "is either an incense dispenser or a ceremonial sacrophagus" due to his knowledge of only prehistoric German)</p>

			<p>Since I've taken Latin as my foreign language for every year possible, I haven't really learned to speak any foreign languages through a class-system. </p>
