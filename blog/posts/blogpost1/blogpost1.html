			<h1 style="font-style: bold">The Beauty and Applicability of Languages</h1>
			<h6 class="date">September 1, 2019</h6>

			<p>One of the coolest parts of being an exchange student is being able to learn the language of the nation. I'm bilingual, speaking both English and Tamil, but I am merely a speaker of the latter. In other words, I certainly can't read or right the langauge, and I know very little about grammatical constructions. I also have been taking latin for the past five, going on six, years, which has given me a strong background in grammar. </p>

			<p>Something I've noticed since I started taking Latin was the lack of emphasis on grammar within middle and high school English classes. I understand that as native speakers, it isn't very necessary for us to learn or actively think about the grammar of the language, but the last few weeks have taught me the importance of having this background grammatical knowledge when learning a new language.</p>

			<p>A little background on the Bosnian language before I talk about classes: The Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian languages (along with Montenegrin which isn't officially a language yet) are nearly identical as they all originated from the Serbo-Croat language. However, after the Civil War in the 1990s, political and demographic tensions between the newly separated nations resulted in these languages being considered as officially distinct. So in other words, by learning any of the four languages fluently, you could fluently communicate in any of the other three nations, along with any other nations with those as the main languages.</p>

			<p>Anyways, our Bosnian lessons began two days after we arrived here. We initially started learning phrases, but we quickly dove into learning about grammatical concepts. As we began talking about verb tenses, I quickly began to notice many striking similarities between Latin and Bosnian. For one thing, like Latin, Bosnian is a conjugation and declining based language. In other words, different uses of a single word (ex. direct object, indirect object, possesive, verb tenses, etc.) are formed by simply changing the ending of the word. However, during those lessons, I began to realize that these similarities were only becoming apparent to me since these were the only two languages I had a strong grammatical background for. </p>

			<p>As I think about our lessons, I felt that being familiar with Latin grammar has really made learning Bosnian much simpler for me than for people not really aware about many grammatical constructions. This leads me to my main topic of concern though: I feel that native English speakers do not receive nearly enough of the grammatical background in their own language. </p>

			<p>I personally cannot remember much about my English classs prior to 5th Grade, but I certainly do not remember much grammar being taught at those ages. At its furthest, I recall brief discussions about the meanings of the different parts of speech, and even those were so scarce that I didn't learn the meaning of such terms until taking Latin.</p>

			<p>However, I and one other person from my Bosnia cohort at my school currently attend English classes at school. After the first week of school, the entire cohort met up for the weekend, during which the two of us displayed our astonishment towards the emphasis which our English class placed on grammar. And it does make sense: essentially all of the students in our English classes are not native speakers, and it would make sense to learn a second language from the ground up. But what I found to be the main kicker is that their Bosnian classes at school placed an equally, if not greater, emphasis on grammatical constructions. And from talking with my classmates, I gained the impression that learning all of that grammar in their native language classes expedited the English learning process for them a lot.</p>

			<p>Overall, I believe that it's important to emphasize grammar within our classrooms. I truly understand that doing so may seem redundant, especially due to the fact that many of these concepts come naturally to native speakers. However, as I have learned through my time with Latin and Bosnian, knowing what's going on under the hood of our langauge is invaluable while inspecting and studying that of another.</p>
