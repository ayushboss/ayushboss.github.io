			<h1 style="font-style: bold">Zdravo Bosna i Herzegovina!!</h1>
			<h6 class="date">August 21, 2019</h6>
			<p>Two days into my time in Bosnia and Herzegovina has completely changed my perception of balance, size, and myself. I did not at all anticipate the first days in my transition to a new lifestyle and culture being as difficult as it has been, and although its been emotionally and physically taxing, I feel that this experience is magical and that I will cherish the memories of my culture shock as the year progresses.</p>

			<p>My journey began on the morning of August 19. At 7:35 A.M, my United flight departed from George Bush Intercontinental Airport &mdash or at least it was supposed to. Instead, my departure was postponed by 2 hours as an engine malfunction was discovered as the plane prepared to liftoff, accompanying a string of delays that plagued the entire YES-Bosnia Crew.</p>

			<p>3 hours later, my flight arrived at Dulles International Airport, where the YES-Bosnia Gang slowly trickled into the gate. After several hours, filled by our hopeful discussion about our Bosnian lives, many episodes of The Office, and a pre-departure Instagram (@yes_bosnia) Q&A session, we set off from US soil for the last time in ten months (of course with a two hour delay on the Dulles runway!)</p>

			<p>The 9 hour flight from DC to Vienna, Austria proved to be one of the toughest ones I have been on (perhaps because my TV screen didn't work lol). However, our arrival in Vienna signified one thing: our journey was almost complete, and we were just one hour (of flight, we still had layover!) from our new lives in BiH. Apprehension and anxiety filled all of our minds as we stressed about every imaginable aspect of life in our new home (I asked one of my cohort members "Do you think Selma (our coordinator in Sarajevo) will take it as an insult if I wear my jacket over my YES shirt?"). We passed the layover time by getting kicked out of our gate four hours early and with several attempts at playing Phase 10, and soon, we made our way onto the "giant flying metal box" that would carry us to our final destination.</p>

			<p>As we touched down in Sarajevo, I went through perhaps the most complicated emotional sequences I have gone through. My mind was cloudy with all of the thoughts of moving to a new nation. One part of me was downcast at the prospect of not being able to see my family and friends for nearly a year, while another part of me was excited to see who and what awaited me through the doors of Gate 2 of the Sarajevo International Airport, and a third part of me writhed in nervousness about the expectations of my host family. My mind raced as we cleared Passport Checks, claimed our baggages, and made our way through the final tunnel leading out to the entrance of the airport. I had no idea what to exepct from my host family and was nervous to find out.</p>

			<p>As soon as we found ourselves at the entrance, I was met with a giant hug from my host mother. As I embraced her back, I realized that I would not have to worry about lacking a parental connection during my time abroad. Selma (our local coordinator from before) coralled all of our cohort together, took a photo of us, and urged us on out of the airport with our host families. </p>

			<p>My host father had been waiting in the family car outside of the airport. I greeted him with a meek "Zdravo!", and he responded with some rapid-fire Bosnian which he followed by straightening my back. The car ride home was spent in silence as neither of my host parents knew English, and instead, I stared outside at the beautiful scenery of Sarajevo. Occasionally, my host mother would point out interesting and important landmarks of Sarajevo, such as the Sarajevo City Center, the City Hall, and my future school, Druga Gimnnazija.</p>

			<p>The first day turned out to be really short for me. As soon as we got home, my host mother revealed that she had prepared lunch for me before they had picked me up (cheese pasta and bread!), and so all of us, including my host brother Irfan, gathered at the table to eat our lunch. Following the filling meal, my host parents showed me my room and around the house, and after unpacking my clothes, I quickly passed out onto my bed, not to awake until 3 AM the next morning (when I'm writing this!)</p>

			<p>I still haven't come to terms with the fact that I'm going to be spending the next ten months on completely foreign terrain learning about a totally new culture! Although it seems like an unsurmountable challenge just one day in, I know that I'm going to love this experience as I become more comfortable with my surroundings! I'll keep you posted!</p>
